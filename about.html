    Hi! I'm Alice! I'm a 19 year old neurodivergent trans girl and a writer! ^v^ <br>My pronouns are She/Her but I'm cool with basically anything thats not masculine.<br> I aspire to be a lot of things but writing is my focus! I deeply love reading. From novels, to fanfic, to manga, to whatever! I also love anime despite my struggles with actually focusing on it. ðŸ˜… I have a lot of hyperfixations but RWBY is my special interest!<br> You can see more of the things I like on my <a href="/interests.html">Interests</a> page!<br> I'm a very creative person but I struggle with the motivation to actually make things. I'm getting better every day though and you can see the things I actually put out on my <a href="/creations.html">Creations</a> page! <br>Finally you can find me on social media at my <a href="/links.html">Links</a> page.<br> I'm always open to meeting new people and my DM's are open but I'm also a very anxious person, I'm sorry if I don't respond to your DM's!
